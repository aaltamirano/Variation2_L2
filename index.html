			<li>From childhood’s hour I have not been</li>

			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h4>As others saw—I could not bring</h4>
			<li><h1>My passions from a common spring—</h1>
			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the same source I have not taken
			<li>My sorrow—I could not awaken
			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h1>My heart to joy at the same tone—</h1> 
			<li>And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h3>Then—in my childhood—in the dawn</h3> 
			<li><h2>Of a most stormy life—was drawn</h2> 
			<li>From ev’ry depth of good and ill 
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<li><h4>The mystery which binds me still—</h4>
			<li>From the torrent, or the fountain— 
			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h4>From the red cliff of the mountain—</h4>
			<li>From the sun that ’round me roll’d
			<li>In its autumn tint of gold—
			<li>From the lightning in the sky
			<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<li><h3>As it pass’d me flying by—</h3>
			<li>From the thunder, and the storm—
			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<li><h3>And the cloud that took the form</h3> 
			<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<li><h3>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</h3> 
			<li>Of a demon in my view—
